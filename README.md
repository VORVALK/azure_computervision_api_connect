# Sample code to implement an API to AzureAI CustomVision

This code can be used as starting point to implement a tool able to communicate with an Azure AI CustomVision trained model

The class Predict.py can predict an image from a local folder or from an url vs a trained and published model

The class Visio_AI.py tries to identify an image and its elements vs the Azure ComputerVision resource.
